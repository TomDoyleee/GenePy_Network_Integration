# GenePy Network Integration and Analysis Tool

Repository for in silico research project, involving integration of [Genepy](https://github.com/UoS-HGIG/GenePy-1.4) scores for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) with PPI networks generated by [String](https://string-db.org) for downstream network analysis. (https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-2877-3)

Currently using network analysis, protein-protein interaction data and gene pathogenicity scores to investigate and try to identify sub-networks or funtional modules that are indicative of mechanism.


Python modules include:

`get_data.py` `get_patient.py` `get_PPI.py` `get_patient_networks.py` `get_network_analysis.py` `cytoscape.py`


## Requirements 
* Python 3.8.x
* Genepy score matrix
* Disease Phenotype table (PatientID and Diagnosis)

> For Python dependancies see `requirements.txt`


## get_data module
Functions to import Genepy matrix and generate pandas dataframes for binarised scores and subsets for Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Can also be used for other disease phenotypes.

> Scores can be optionally weighted by [LOEUF](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2308-7#data-availability) to decrease the succeptability of mutational constraint. LOEUF scores are avaliable [here](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/downloads) under the 'Constraint' heading. Methods can be found in this [paper](https://academic.oup.com/ibdjournal/article/28/6/912/6492639)


## get_patient module
Functions to pull down relevant individual patient information. Optional API call to pull down [String](https://string-db.org/cgi/input?sessionId=bZ3itUxvQis0&input_page_active_form=single_identifier) IDs for a given list of genes from Genepy matrix.

## get_PPI module
Functions to pull down Protein-Protein Interactions (PPI's) from the StringDB using their API. Both functional and physical interactons. 

## get_patient_networks module
Designed to run in the console, utilises multiprocessing to download individual patient networks and save into 'patient_networks/' directory.

## get_network_analysis module 
Functions to generate NetworkX graphs as Multigraphs or lists of individual patient networks. Some added functions to help analyse given networks.

## cytoscape module 
Functions to generate graphs in Cytoscape for visulisation and further analysis.
